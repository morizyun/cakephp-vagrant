Install basic CakePHP development box using Vagrant and Puppet
=======================

## Overview

Vagrant is a great tool to automate creating and configuring lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. If you are new to Vagrant you might want to take a look at [official documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html) to get a basic gist who is it for and why to use it.

## Host OS software prerequisites:

- Vagrant depends on Oracle's [VirtualBox][] to create all of its virtual environments.
- Download and install [Vagrant][]

## Installation:

- Make sure you've installed prerequisites
- Open terminal, `cd` to working directory and clone the project
    `git clone git://github.com/borivojevic/cakephp-vagrant.git`
- Place application source code into cakephp-vagrant/webroot folder
- On the host machine, add a new line to your `hosts` file pointing to vagrant box' `33.33.33.10 dev.mirkoborivojevic.localhost`
- Run `vagrant up` to provision machine
- Run web browser and go to `http://dev.mirkoborivojevic.localhost`
- To log in to vagrant box execute `ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222`
- To turn off virtual machine execute `vagrant down`
- To clean up execute `vagrant destroy`

## Default connection parameters

[VirtualBox]: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## Troubleshooting

VirtualBox sometimes hangs on "Waiting for VM to boot. This can take a few minutes". To fix this enable GUI mode in Vagrant configuration, login in VirtualBox and run "sudo dhclient".
